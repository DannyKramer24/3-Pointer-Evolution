  <h1 class="hed">Taking Them and Making Them </h1>
  <p class="dek">Since the introduction of the 3-pointer, all teams have done is shoot more of them. NBA teams taking and making more <br> 3-pointers is not only increasing offensive ratings, but proving that the most efficient offense might come further from the hoop. </p>

      <p>The Boston Celtics finished the regular season with a league-leading 64-18 record. While the flashy 64 turned some heads, "3" might be the more important number. This past offseason, Celtics President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens honed in on finding talent that could shoot the deep ball, and it has paid off. </p>

      <p>Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla’s heavy 3-point style of play came to be known as “Mazzulla Ball.” Watching the games, the emphasis on 3-point shooting is apparent, but the numbers reinforce the same story. </p>

      <p>With the regular season recently concluding, Boston’s 3-point numbers were staggering for a team with seven more wins than the next-best team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Boston led the league with <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-threes-attempted-this-season-by-a-team">3,482 attempted threes </a> and <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-threes-made-this-season-by-a-team">1,351 made threes </a>. The 3,482 attempted threes came out to 240 more than the next-highest team this year, with the 1,351 made threes exceeding the second-highest total by 140. </p>

      <p>Boston seems to be exploiting the 3-point shot, and a deep dive into the numbers reflects why it has been so effective. The data used covers the National Basketball Association (NBA) league averages per game.</p>

      <p> While the Celtics might be the most accomplished 3-point shooting team right now, the rest of the league has been playing a similar style thanks to the analytics. The data shows that 3-point attempts and 3-pointers made have generally been exponentially rising ever since the 3-point shot was incorporated in 1979.

        <p> Brent Huot, a Syracuse University Sport Analytics graduate, says that the increased prevalence of the 3-pointer marks a shift in the game of basketball. “As the focus shifts to taking more threes, more players are working on it with their coaches and teams, and you see the talent coming into the league has evolved to focus on 3-point shooting more than in the past,” says Huot. </p>

        <p>The shooting talent has certainly improved because 3-point percentage has also gradually risen despite the increase in attempts. Through March 7, the NBA is shooting the most 3-pointers per game and is simultaneously tied for its highest 3-point percentage per game since the 3-point line was included. </p>

        <p>Huot explains that one key factor in the increasing prevalence of 3-point shooting in NBA games is the analytics revolution in basketball. “[The analytics are] leading to adapted strategies from teams to prioritize 3-point shooting as a result of a lot of teams catching on to this trend and trying to put it into effect,” says Huot. </p>

        <p>Offensive rating—an estimate of points scored per 100 possessions—and points scored per game are the highest it’s ever been since the introduction of the 3-point shot. This is despite the pace of play being only a little above the average over the past 44 years along with a continued decline in free throw attempts. </p>

        <p>Huot focuses again on analytics to explain the growth in offensive rating. “To highlight the efficiency of 3-point shots compared to midrange shots, in summary, hitting 33.4% of your 3-point shots is more efficient than hitting 50% of your 2-point shots,” says Huot. </p>

        <p>Somewhat surprisingly, age, height, and weight have not fluctuated much from the 1979-1980 season to the 2023-2024 season. There is a misconception that players are much taller and stronger in the modern NBA, but the data shows that it’s been pretty consistent over this 44 year timespan. </p>
      
        <p>Huot, however, is not surprised by the constancy of age, weight, and height. “I don’t think it’s entirely surprising that age, height, and weight haven’t fluctuated that much. I think it’s really just you have the same builds physically and these guys are adapting their game,” says Huot. </p>

        <p>The question becomes if the game will revert back to old playstyles, leading to a decrease in the amount of 3-pointers teams are shooting. Just because it is a trend, it seems unlikely that the rate teams are shooting 3-pointers will limitlessly grow. </p>

        <p>Huot doubts the trend continues because of the constant evolution of the game of basketball. At some point, teams are going to figure out a way to restrain its effectiveness, and coaches will alter their game plans. </p>

        <p>“Eventually teams are going to start looking at ‘Alright everyone’s on this trend of an increase in 3-point attempts per game, what’s the next trend we can get ahead of,’” Huot says, “And they’ll try and implement that.” </p>
